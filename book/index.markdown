There are dozens of Java frameworks out there, but most of them require
you to learn special coding techniques and new, often rigid, patterns
of development. Wicket is different. As a component-based web
application framework, Wicket lets you build maintainable
enterprise-grade web applications using the power of plain old Java
objects (POJOs), HTML, Ajax, Spring, Hibernate, and Maven. Wicket
automatically manages state at the component level, which means no more
awkward HTTPSession objects. Its elegant programming model enables you
to write rich web applications quickly.

**Wicket in Action** is an authoritative, comprehensive guide for Java
developers building Wicket-based web applications. This book starts
with an introduction to Wicket's structure and components, and moves
quickly into examples of Wicket at work. Written by two of the
project's earliest and most authoritative experts, this book shows you
both the “how-to” and the “why” of Wicket. As you move through the
book, you'll learn to use and customize Wicket components, how to
interact with other technologies like Spring and Hibernate, and how to
build rich, Ajax-driven features into your applications.
