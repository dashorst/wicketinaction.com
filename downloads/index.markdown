We have done our best to make a lot of information freely available.
Here you can download sample chapters and the accompanying code so you
don't have to type in all the examples yourself.

### Free content

To make your decision whether or not to buy Wicket in Action a little
more easier we've provided some sample chapters for you to peruse. If
you like these chapters, then there are 12 more waiting for your
attention. Save the following links to get the sample chapters:

 * [Chapter 1 What is Wicket?][1]
 * [Chapter 8 Developing reusable components][2]
 * [Chapter 15 Setting up a Wicket project][3]

### Code

Most of the source code in this book is part of a Google Code project
you can find at [http://code.google.com/p/wicketinaction/][4],
and which is [ASF 2.0][5] licensed.

We aimed for a smooth narrative by employing an evolving example
throughout the chapters. We hope the examples, which talk about a
cheese store, arenâ€™t too far fetched; we tried to make the book fun for
you to read while addressing the technical nuances we had in mind.

The downloadable source code is structured in packages that reflect the
chapters so that you can easily play with the code while reading the
book. Trying things for yourself is a great way to learn technology.

The code in this book is pretty much printed as is, with the exception
of the imports that are needed to compile the code. You can find those
imports in the Google Code project, although in most cases asking your
IDE to autocomplete them for you should work fine.
