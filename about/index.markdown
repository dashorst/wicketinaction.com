Welcome to **Wicket in Action**, the companion website for the the
authoritative book on <strong>Apache Wicket</strong> and an ongoing
blog with news and informative articles about developing with Apache
Wicket. Here you'll find examples, downloads and useful links to
resources related to Wicket and Wicket in Action.

Apache Wicket is an open source, component oriented Java web
application framework. Wicket lets you build maintainable
enterprise-grade web applications using the power of plain old Java
objects (POJOs), HTML, Ajax, Spring, Hibernate, and Maven. Wicket
automatically manages state at the component level, which means no more
awkward HTTPSession objects. Its elegant programming model enables you
to write rich web applications quickly.

If you want to learn more about Wicket, you can download the free
chapters of Wicket in Action, or visit the Apache Wicket website.
