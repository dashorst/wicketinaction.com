<p>Something special is brewing in downtown London on Saturday, 21st November. jWeekend is organizing a very special event at the iconic Foyles Bookshop in central London. </p>
<p>Join core committers Matej, Alastair, Jeremy and Martijn together with WiQuery gurus Richard and Lionel for an afternoon of intellectual Wicketness.</p>
<p>Join us for some very interesting, high quality presentations and to chat with fellow Wicket users and developers at all levels. We're expecting this to be another popular event and since places are limited book and confirm early if you can make it. Details and registration are at <a href="http://jweekend.com">the usual place</a>.</p>
<p>There is a cool little Jazz cafe at Foyles too, where there'll be a live act (Femi Temowo) at 13:00 if you enjoy some Jazz guitar relaxation before your intellectual stimulation. They offer a decent range of food and drink there too.</p>
<p>I'll be available to sign some books, so Bring Your Copy of Wicket in Actionâ€”or buy one in the store and have it signed!</p>
