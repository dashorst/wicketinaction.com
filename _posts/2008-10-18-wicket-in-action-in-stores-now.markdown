<p>Jonathan Locke was kind enough to spot a physical copy of Wicket in Action in a <a href="http://web.mac.com/jonathan.locke/iWeb/JonathanLocke/Blog/5DD44C7B-0C5E-4125-B6FB-985842E0E70A.html">Barnes and Noble book store</a>. I never thought that having a physical copy of a book would be so rewarding and make the book that more real. Writing a book, getting it published by a publisher and seeing it in stores is something really special that can&#039;t be captured in words. It is bigger than writing your thesis. I&#039;m not sure if it is more rewarding than writing your weekly TPS report though.</p>
