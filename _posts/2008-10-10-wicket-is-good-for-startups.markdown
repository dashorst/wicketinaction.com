<p>The <a href="http://www.fembusiness.nl/web/1029268/artikelSmal/Fast-50-de-top-10.htm">50 fastest growing technology companies in the Netherlands</a> is a competition where the relative revenue growth over the last 5 years are taken into account and companies ranked accordingly.</p>
<p>
In 2004 my company (<a href="http://topicus.nl">Topicus</a>) was number 1, even above <a href="http://tomtom.com">tomtom</a>. Even after 4 years we are still in the top 50 of fastest growing companies in the Netherlands and can now use the title of "Sustainable Grower". This is a great testatement to the management and employees of Topicus.</p>
<p>
Even though this is something special, I'd like to point out that at least 4 companies in the fast 50 are using Wicket in their day to day business: <a href="http://topicus.nl">Topicus</a>, <a href="http://servoy.com">Servoy</a> (#8 in the top 50, congratulations!), <a href="http://xebia.nl">Xebia</a> and <a href="http://hippo.nl">Hippo</a>. In my not so humble opinion, using Wicket gives them a competitive advantage. The fact that Topicus is the Sustainable Grower (Topicus is a long time supporter and contributor to Wicket) provides ample evidence.</p>
<p>
Long story short: Wicket is good for our companies, why don't you use it yet?</p>
