    basic swing-like reusable component design and the detachable models that make
    it all 'just work' with remarkably scalable efficiency.  Not sure whether the
    great community at wicket-user mail list attracted/invented the good design or
    the other way around, but a nice feedback loop seems to be involved there.\r\n\r\nWhat's

    without any effort on my part. The first time I realised how this worked, it came
    as a revelation.\r\n\r\nWhat I hate: there is no simple, easy, and supported way
    to set up a database backend in Wicket. Hibernate, Spring, JPA, Databinder, Warp
    persist, Guice, relational or object based, what to choose and how to combine
    the parts? The options that seem to be supported the most (Spring/Hibernate) are
    definitely not the easiest and ones that seem simple (Databinder) are unmaintained.
    I'd be delighted if there were a database backend for Wicket that's guaranteed
    to be supported for the forseeable future without the un-Wicket-like XML configuration
    mess."

    an incredible framework, that perhaps could be improved by adding more support
    to include charts and multimedia contents.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, congratulations on

    favourite feature of Wicket is the fact that web pages and web components are
    real Java objects, and that their on-click events are handled by methods within
    these objects. (This allows me to indulge in my love of Java, too.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA
    feature in Wicket I hate the most and how it can be improved\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCompile-time
    warnings say that I should not use enclosures in my HTML mark-up to surround my
    web controls but that I should use containers instead. This negates the ease of
    coding of enclosures at both the mark-up and code ends.\r\n\r\nI would really
    like it if the inner workings of Wicket could be changed to allow the use of enclosures
    in mark-up for any reasonable web component including web controls."

  content: "A feature in Wicket you love:\r\n\r\n- The model/component -separation
    and everything about it. It allows you to separate ui components and data and
    also application logic from ui-logic.\r\nAlso the thing that Wicket handles automatically
    when model is called and detached eliminates lot's of boiler plate code.\r\n\r\nA
    feature in Wicket you hate:\r\n- Quickstart. There is no way to get to know Wicket
    quickly. The problem is that the thing that I love about Wicket is something you
    need to learn by experience. And that would be something to improve as that's
    the main thing you need to understand in order to use Wicket effectively.\r\nI
    think almost all the Wicket Basics tutorials just focus on the markup separation
    and they teach you to inject your services / daos directly to the component and
    totally overlook the IModel -interface. And as a result that's what all the beginners
    do.\r\nI think this could be improved by documentation and providing good examples
    of the model/component -separation."

    are very good books out there about Wicket and Apache Wicket Cookbook is probably
    the best for average/expert Wicket developer.\r\nBut I also think that great framework

    also love the new wicket 1.5 way of serving pages which \"magically\" (I am sure
    with much effort) resolved a couple of major errors for me.\r\n\r\nDislike:\r\n-The
    verbosity of some areas of code, which I feel is un-necessary. For instance, AjaxBehaviors
    one cannot get the full call-back script, instead they must use wicketAjaxGet
    in a static string with the generated url.\r\n-Although I do like models and how
    they act as an interface for the component many times it is difficult to debug
    models in regard to why they haven't changed or become stale etc.... Perhaps in
    debug mode there might be a way to watch for variables changing while the model
    instance does not etc... and warn for these areas instead of requiring a user
    to write test cases, though the latter is likely optimal this might help newer
    users.\r\n\r\nNeutral:\r\nI do think there should be some simple pre-setup code
    banks so that someone can immediately deal with a flavour or two of databases.
    As most JEE apps have databases it might be quite interesting, I have written
    many tutorials to facilitate this, but maintained code is always better.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat
    being said I do love that Wicket is not bloated with un-necessary items."

    is perfect for long running projects where the biggest part of cost is cost of

    I always have problems to make it right (through the mounting mechanism). Learning
    curve is pretty steep, because of Model idiom and strong OO way of doing things.
    And yup... better stateless support would be handy.

    If you know how to use Wicket you already know how to make components. This way
    there's no need for one guy to be the guru of the team that is the only one who
    can make them - or even worse, no-one has time to learn it (I've seen that with
    another framework, btw). With Wicket you also have very good control of the HTML
    that gets rendered in the end. Any framework that doesn't let you do that is a
    nightmare IMO.\r\n\r\nHate: Currently I dislike it when I have to write manual
    code that detaches models. The code tends to become unreadable (hard to figure
    out what the purpose of the code is). My suggestion is that models would automatically
    register themselves in some common object that would be in charge of detaching
    all models. I suspect my idea wouldn't work in practice, though.\r\n\r\nPlease

  content: "- The feature I like the most on wicket is the ajax support, without writing
    a singe line of javascript you can do very complex ajax stuff.\r\n\r\n- What I
    sometimes hate is that you always need to add wicket IDs to stuff even when there's
    only one possibility, for example. If you want to build out of the page a layout,
    say something like a swing BorderLayout the framework could really tell where
    to place the components but wicket forces you to add a wicket id and therefore
    html code to it.\r\nThe solution: many times components may infer the wicket id
    out of the very same context, for example you place an accordion component and
    add some panels to it, you could automatically assign the wicket id or try with
    a default behavior. That wold ease things a lot.\r\n\r\n- Another thing that I
    haven't seen on wicket and would be great is theme support, not all of us are
    graphics designers and most of the times we need to develop nice user interfaces
    quickly so it would be nice if we could have some themes to choose from and make
    easily a consistent-looking web app.\r\n\r\nAnyway framework is great and love
    it.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    regions, featured by other Ajax frameworks, but in a simpler manner, as the concept
    maps to plain HTML forms and also it is not tied to Ajax.\r\n\r\nI hate the lack

  content: "What I love:\r\nWicket encourages refactoring and reuse of custom components.
    It's easy to get an application running, and wicket app code is intuitive and
    clean. The design of the system enables code-reuse, refactoring, and the practice
    of good OO design principles. The separation of markup, HTML, and java keeps the
    code from getting cluttered.\r\n\r\nWhat I hate (and how to improve it):\r\nI
    would like to see more of wicket's framework code written against interfaces.
    Although it's laudable that wicket supports unit testing, the design isn't always
    conducive to simple unit tests for client code.\r\n\r\nA simple example... suppose
    I write some client code for configuring a component:\r\n\r\npublic static void
    makeRequired(Component c) {\r\n c.setRequired(true);\r\n c.add(new AsteriskWhenRequiredBehavior());\r\n}\r\n\r\nI
    would like to write a unit test that looks like:\r\n\r\nComponentStub c = new
    ComponentStub();\r\nmakeRequired(c);\r\nassertTrue(\"Should be required\", c.isRequired());\r\nList
    expectedBehaviors = new ArrayList();\r\nexpectedBehaviors.add(new AsteriskWhenRequiredBehavior());\r\nassertEquals(\"Wrong
    behaviors\", c.getBehaviors());\r\n\r\nIn order to write a test as I have done
    above, I have to create a concrete subclass of component, and use wicket's unit
    test tooling to stub out the entire request cycle. What I really want to do is
    test only the state information that I've set on the component, so all of that
    infrastructure isn't relevant.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, I would create an interface
    IComponent which Component implements. In my use case, I have:\r\n\r\ninterface
    IComponent {\r\n void add(IBehavior behavior);\r\n void setRequired(boolean required);\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis
    is really all that's needed to unit test my utility code. I can replace references
    to Component with references to IComponent to make the code more loosely coupled
    and testable, use a proxy or mock interface, etc."

    @Russel - use a mocking framework.

    <code>void testMakeRequired() {
      Component c=mock(Component.class);
      expect(c).setRequired(true);
      expect(c).add(matchers.byClass(AsteriskWhenRequiredBehavior.class));
      makeRequired(c);
      verify(c);
    }
    </code>
    look into frameworks like Mockito and EasyMock

    when its required to count row records from a large data set.\r\n - Although simple
    Ajax operations are supported, it take a higher level of the framework understanding
    to use behaviors correctly for simple JavaScript functions\r\n\r\nAs a side note,
    we are still using Wicket 1.3.2 for a Reporting  and Administrative webapp based
    on a very large data. It is the pagination problem that made us abandon Wicket
    as the reporting tool as our reports took more than 2 or 3 minutes to load at
    times. I know this has been improved since ver 1.3 but is almost impossible for
    us to upgrade.\r\n\r\nWe are however inclined to use the latest version of Wicket
