<p>Igor wrote an interesting article covering CDI Conversations and Wicket inÂ <a href="https://www.42lines.net/2011/11/29/leveraging-conversations/">Leveraging Conversations to Reduce Plumbing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>in this article we are going to see how we can use [conversations] to get rid of some plumbing code when binding Wicket components to entities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The code examples are really enticing.</p>
