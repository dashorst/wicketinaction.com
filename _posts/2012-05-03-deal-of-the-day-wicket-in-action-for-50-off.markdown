<p>Wicket in Action is today's "Deal of the Day" over at my publisher, Manning. Use the promo code <strong>dotd0503</strong> for a 50% discount on your purchase of <a href="http://www.manning.com/dashorst">Wicket in Action</a>.</p>
<p>Use promo code <strong>m240</strong> to get a 40% discount for all purchases through Manning, for example <a href="http://www.manning.com/bibeault2">JQuery in Action</a> to prepare for Wicket 6, or <a href="http://manning.com/resig">Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja</a>.</p>
<p>The discounts are mutually exclusive, so you can't have the cake and eat it too, but fortunately it brings in some serious savings! Go ahead and take a look at the <a href="http://manning.com">Manning website</a> and get those books you always wanted, but were afraid to buy!</p>
