<p>As a new item for this blog, I&#039;m going to publish a <a href="http://wicketinaction.com/tag/interview">series of interviews</a> I&#039;m conducting with Wicket community members. I think these interviews can be very interesting for the grander community, as they will unveil the dirty little secrets of your co-community members. Of course the interviews will be mostly focussed on the relationship the interviewee has with Wicket, but I&#039;m not adverse to asking a bit further than that.</p>

<p>The first interview I&#039;ll publish was done with Nino Martinez Wael, and I have a couple more being processed. I&#039;m aiming to publish an interview every week or so as long as I have willing victims. You are of course invited to ask more questions to our guests.
