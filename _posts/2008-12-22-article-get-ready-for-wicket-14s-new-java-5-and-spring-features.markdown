<p>Sualeh Fatehi has written an <a href="http://www.devx.com/webdev/Article/38168">article on Wicket for devx</a> titled "Get Ready for Wicket 1.4's New Java 5 and Spring Features". He explains how to setup a project for Wicket 1.4-m1, and shows you how to do bleeding edge development with Wicket 1.4 snapshots. The article was probably written a while ago, since Wicket 1.4-rc1 has been out for a while now.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is always great to see people support your labor of work with writing articles about it. Thank you Sualeh for taking the time to write this article! Read Sualeh's <a href="http://www.devx.com/webdev/Article/38168">article here</a>.</p>
