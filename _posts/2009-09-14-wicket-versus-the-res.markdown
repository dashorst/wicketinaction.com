  content: I love developing in wicket, but this news just sweetens the experience
    so much more. It really is the way web development should be (from an OO perspective).
    Great news.

<p>Peter Thomas, renowned for his <a href="http://ptrthomas.wordpress.com/2009/01/14/seam-jsf-vs-wicket-performance-comparison">previous comparisons</a> between web frameworks has put all the popular choices of the moment next to one another in <a href="http://ptrthomas.wordpress.com/2009/09/14/perfbench-update-tapestry-5-and-grails/">one short article</a>. I haven't tried the benchmark myself, but I like the results:</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall, Wicket is fastest, with Tapestry coming a close second.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ptrthomas.wordpress.com/2009/09/14/perfbench-update-tapestry-5-and-grails/">Read it yourself</a>, and then confirm the results yourself.</p>
