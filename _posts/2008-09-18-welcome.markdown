<p>Like I announced about a week ago on my blog called <a href="http://martijndashorst.com/blog">A Wicket Diary</a>, I have been creating a new companion website for <a href="http://manning.com/dashorst">Wicket in Action</a>. This website will service as my new home for blogging about <a href="http://wicket.apache.org">Apache Wicket</a>, related events, community news such as releases and I'll be writing about the book.</p>
<p>So don't be a stranger, and add the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/WicketInAction">RSS feed</a> of this site to your news reader and keep an eye out for new content.</p>
