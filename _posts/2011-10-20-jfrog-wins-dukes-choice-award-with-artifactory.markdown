<p>Congratulations are in order for <a href="http://jfrog.com">JFrog</a> who <a href="http://blogs.jfrog.org/2011/10/frog-who-turned-into-prince.html">won a Duke's Choice 2011 Award</a> for their Maven repository manager Artifactoryâ€”coincidentally powered by Apache Wicket.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://java.com/en/dukeschoice/index.jsp">award winner's page</a> at the Oracle website writes:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Innovative Tool for Developers</b></p>
<p>
JFrog JFrog's Artifactory is the world's first binary repository manager. Built with the Content Repository API for Java (JCR) specification, it is helping change the way developers build and manage software modules by delivering high concurrency and unmatched data integrity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At my day job we use Artifactory as our repository manager and it works quite well. Since a year or so we don't have any qualms with it and it just runs wonderfully. We also tried to install Nexus but found that way too complex to setup (with Artifactory we didn't even need to read a installation manual). As a user of Artifactory I say the award is well deserved!</p>
<p>Congratulations to all the hard working folks at JFrog!</p>
