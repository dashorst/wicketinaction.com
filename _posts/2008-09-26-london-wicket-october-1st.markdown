<p>The <a href="http://londonwicket.org/">London Wicket</a> chapter is organizing its bi-monthly event next Wednessday (October 1st). It is hosted again at Google's offices and they have an extra large room this time. They're a bit secretive about the program, but given that <a href="http://londonwicket.org/">last events</a> were well received with some great presentations, this time will be good too.</p>
<p><a href="http://jweekend.com/dev/LWUGReg/">Register now</a> for this event.</p>
