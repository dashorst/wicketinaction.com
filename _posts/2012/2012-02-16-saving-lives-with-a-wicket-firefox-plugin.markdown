<p>The girls and guys of <a href='https://www.42lines.net'>42 Lines</a> have released a set of plugins that enable you to open a specific Wicket component in your <a href='https://www.42lines.net/2012/01/31/announcing-wicket-source/'>Eclipse workspace when looking at it in Firefox</a>. This will save so many hours looking up components in your web page and source code, that it will probably save lives.</p>
<p>And George Armhold has <a href="http://blog.armhold.com/2012/02/16/announcing-wicket-source-plugin-for-intellij-idea/">ported the plugin to IntelliJ's IDEA</a>. Who is going to build this for Netbeans?</p>
