excerpt: "Last November I attended the <a href=\"http://www.oredev.org/\" title=\"Øredev
  \   - Øredev\">Øredev conference</a> in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malmö\"
  title=\"Malmö - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\">Malmö</a> and was given the opportunity
  to present Wicket to a (mostly) Scandinavian audience. Øredev is different from
  all other conferences I\"ve attended because it has different tracks other than
  web and Java. There was a Cool languages track, a Domain Driven Design track, a
  .Net track, a Mobile track and of course a Java track.\r\n\r\nI delivered a newer
  version of the introduction to Wicket presentation and the audience gave me a 4.22
  rating (52x5 points, 33x3 and 0x1 points). Øredev will publish recorded videos of
  the sessions at a later time (I\"m anxiously awaiting at least 2 presentations)
  so you can see my performance yourself. In the mean time you can take a look at
  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/dashorst/wicket-in-actionredev-presentation/\"
  title=\"Wicket In Action - oredev2008 - SlideShare\">the slides on slideshare</a>
  (you\"ll have to imagine my voice for now) or watch them inline below.\r\n"

  content: 'As a general rule I don''t make my presentations available for download:
    I''ve often seen presentations grabbing my stuff and using it without any credits
    whatsoever. I *do* mind people snagging my presentations because they take a long
    time and a lot of effort to create, and even cost money for the pictures. So short
    answer: no.'

  content: 'Quite honestly, I planned something similar: I wanted to use your presentation
    (without revoking any credits though) on manager meetings as a weapon against
    JSF :) It''s a bit more difficult to do the same when it''s only available only
    online.. but hey, generally I agree with your reasons, doing fine prez is a lot
    of work (been there, done that, got the t-shirt), so no problem :)'
