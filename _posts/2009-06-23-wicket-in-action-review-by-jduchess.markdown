<p>The Dutch female Java developer community website <a href="http://jduchess.org">jduchess</a> has written up a <a href="http://jduchess.org/blog/review-wicket-in-action">review of Wicket in Action</a>. They provide a nice summary per chapter detailing the contents of each, and conclude:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wicket in Action is the perfect book if you want to get started with Wicket. [...] It’s also a good book if you’ve already been playing with the framework for a little while and want to really understand what it is you’re working with.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many thanks go to Linda van der Pal for writing this detailed review!</p>
