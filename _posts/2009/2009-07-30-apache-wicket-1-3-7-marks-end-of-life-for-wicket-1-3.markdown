excerpt: The Apache Wicket team is proud to present the release of <a href="http://wicket.apache.org">Apache
  Wicket 1.3.7</a>. This will be the last feature release for the 1.3.x branch. Going
  forward, only security fixes will be released in the 1.3.x branch - meaning that
  1.3.7 may be the last release in this branch. All users are encouraged to upgrade
  to 1.4.0 as soon as possible. As work begins on 1.5 in the near future, we will
  be supporting 1.4.x and 1.5.x.
