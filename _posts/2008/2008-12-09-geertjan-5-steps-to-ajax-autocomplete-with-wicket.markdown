<p><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/geertjan">Geertjan</a> is a Netbeans guy, and he has been writing about Netbeans and Wicket for as long as I've known him. Today he published a new blog entry showing how to create an Ajax auto-complete text field with Netbeans' Wicket support and Wicket in <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/geertjan/entry/ajax_can_it_get_better">5 easy steps</a>. Can it get any better?</p>
