<p><a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/">Confluence</a> is a Java based, enterprisey WIKI that is built using the precursor to Struts 2. So I consider it newsworthy when someone takes the time to write about extending Confluence with the best web technology currently available: Apache Wicket. <a href="http://netsuke.wordpress.com/2008/11/02/extending-confluence-using-wicket/">Gustavo explains</a> how to do just so:</p>
<blockquote><p>The advantage would be avoiding completely XWork, possibility to use wicket advanced features and possibility to run the feature outside confluence (more testable).</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the write up, Gustavo!</p>
