<p>I'm in the fortunate position that I can join the ranks of the best presenters and technologists in the world and present Apache Wicket at the <a href="http://www.oredev.com">Øredev</a> conference in Malmö next thursday (November 20th&mdash;which also happens to be my birthday). I'm flying into Copenhagen tomorrow and will be joining the ranks of Bruce Snyder, Alef Arendsen and Robert C. Martin for the speakers dinner.</p>
<p>
I'm looking forward to meeting all those new guys, and especially <a href="http://wicketinaction.com/2008/10/meet-the-wicket-community-nino-martinez-wael/">Nino</a> who is trying to interview me this time.</p>
