<p>Ryan Heaton has published an <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/a-rich-web-service-api-your-fa-2" title="A Rich Web Service API for Your Favorite Framework, Part 4: Wicket | Javalobby">introductory article</a> on integrating his open source web services project called <a href="http://enunciate.codehaus.org/" title="enunciate">Enunciate</a> in your Wicket application. It is a great introduction to Enunciate if you haven't tried it yet, and shows how easy it is to get started.
