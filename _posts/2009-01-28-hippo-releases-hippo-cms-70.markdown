<p>This is big news for the Wicket community: the Hippo guys have <a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/open-source-cms/open-source-hippo-cms-70-gets-revamped-core-003822.php">just released</a> the big 7.0 version of their open source CMS product. The Hippo developers are big fans of Wicket, and use it in their product. Not only do they use Wicket, they also provide support for Wicket's portlet implementation. Being big fans of everything Apache, they use the following technologies in Hippo CMS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apache Jetspeed</li>
<li>Apache JackRabbit</li>
<li>Apache Wicket</li>
<li>Apache Lucene</li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations go to the Hippo team and keep up the good work! Now, if you are interested in their product, you can download it from the <a href="http://www.onehippo.org/cms7/delve_into/quickstart.html">Hippo website</a>.</p>
