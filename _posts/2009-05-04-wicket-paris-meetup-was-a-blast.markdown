  content: "Yes, it was a great evening.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed talking with you. It is
    really interesting to talk with a committer of such a good framework.\r\n\r\nAnd
    in french : Merci Martin, ce fut un plaisir de discuter avec toi.\r\n\r\nA bientôt,\r\nTom\r\n\r\nPS:
    As a french, I protest against \"The lack of Wicket in the IT Industry ! More,
    more, more, we want more Wicket !\". Hum, maybe, too much champagne for me :-)"

<p>I just returned from Paris where I was speaking (as the sole presenter!) at the Wicket meetup organized by <a href="http://zenika.com">Zenika</a>. The event was really well organized (champagne before and after) and the audience was kind and attentive. I enjoyed the experience very much. Zenika ét tous qui étaient lá: merçi beaucoup!</p>

<p>Just a couple of tips for folks travelling to Paris: the Thalys service is great. If you have an iPhone, purchase the Paris Metro application and finally avoid going to Paris on May 1st (everything is closed and the french are exercising their national pastime: protesting).</p>
<p>ps. with thanks to my dad who pointed out my bad french language skills...</p>
